CSE focuses on developing problem-solving methodologies and robust tools for numerical simulation. To understand phenomena and processes from science and engineering, we no longer need to depend only on theory and experiment, but can also use computations. Numerical simulations supplement experiments and can even allow the examination of systems and problems that would be too time-consuming, expensive, or dangerous (if possible at all) to study by experiment alone. The high level of detail and realism in these simulations requires advanced skills in mathematical modeling, numerical analysis, efficient algorithms, computer architecture, software design and implementation, validation, and visualization of results. This program equips engineering, science, or mathematics graduates with the skills required for a successful professional or academic career in CSE. Upon graduating with a M.Sc. in Computational Science and Engineering, you possess a great portfolio of skills in the areas of Computer Science, Numerical Analysis, Scientific Computing as well as their relevant Applications, Methods and Techniques.
